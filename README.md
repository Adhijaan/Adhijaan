I'd like to showcase some of my projects, unfortuantley all were for companies or organizations that have requested private repos. However, I competed in Mhacks, the largest hackathon in the midwest where I created a project with a team. Over 24 hrs we made an interactive map that dispalyed presedential election results by state and year. Check it out [here](https://github.com/shivanshnu/Mhacks-political_map)
